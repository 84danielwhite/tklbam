# volsize: size of backup volumes in MBs

volsize 50

# full-backup: time frequency of full backup
# (in between full backups we do incremental backups)
#
#   format := <int>[DWM]
#     
#     e.g.,
#     3D - three days
#     2W - two weeks
#     1M - one month

full-backup 1M

# restore-cache-size: the maximum size of the download cache in restore-cache-dir
# 
# This will come in handy when:
# 1) resuming big restores (already downloaded backup archives don't need to be re-downloaded)
# 2) if you make a mistake and need to rollback the restore and try again
#
# e.g.,
#       1000MB
#       2GB
#       50% - 50% of free space in the restore-cache-path

restore-cache-size 50%
